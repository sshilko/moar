title: iOS9 ATS on Amazon AWS Elastic Load Balancers
---

#### Introduction

Since Apple is introducing App Transport Security (ATS) with iOS 9 and OS X 10 making effort for best security practices.
For developers it means ([according to iOS Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016198-DontLinkElementID_12)):

> If you’re developing a new app, you should use HTTPS exclusively. If you have an existing app, you should use HTTPS as much as you can right now, and create a plan for migrating the rest of your app as soon as possible. In addition, your communication through higher-level APIs needs to be encrypted using TLS version 1.2 with forward secrecy. If you try to make a connection that doesn't follow this requirement, an error is thrown.

#### Follow up

Assuming basic knowledge with AWS ELB (read the previous article on [High-grade Encryption with Amazon AWS Elastic Load Balancers](/2014/10/01/AWS-ELB-SSLTLS)),

what needs to be done is:

1. make sure to use **TLS 1.2 ONLY**
2. enable FS [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy).
   In Transport Layer Security (TLS), Diffie–Hellman key exchange-based PFSs (DHE-RSA, DHE-DSS) and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman-based PFSs (ECDHE-RSA, ECDHE-ECDSA) are available.

ECDSA keys are something to look forward in future (only <1% ECDSA keys in use, as majority keys are RSA keys)

1. [with ECDSA](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/) you can get the same level of security as RSA but with smaller keys
2. smaller keys have **faster algorithms** for generating signatures because the math involves smaller numbers
3. smaller public keys mean smaller certificates and **less data to pass around to establish a TLS connection**
4. ECDSA keys do **NOT** have yet hardware acceleration

This means quicker connections and faster loading times on websites using ECDSA key, but existing software uses hardware-accelerated RSA & AES, so
at the moment the speed is not the major factor.

Lets have a look at cypher candidates [TLS 1.2 cyphers](https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#TLS-v1.2-cipher-suites):

{% highlight text %}
https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#TLS-v1.2-cipher-suites

#normal RSA (CBC) (no-forward-secrecy)
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256           AES128-SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256           AES256-SHA256

#fast RSA (GCM) (no-forward-secrecy)
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256           AES128-GCM-SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384           AES256-GCM-SHA384

#normal FS (CBC)
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256     ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384     ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384

#fast FS (GCM)
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256     ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384     ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384

{% endhighlight %}

The cypher naming convention can be found [here](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SSLCipherNames), or [here at wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_suite) i.e.

> DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA.
This means DHE for key exchange,
RSA for server certificate authentication,
256-bit key AES for the stream cipher,
and SHA for the message authentication.

#### And the winner is ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256

The best option here is (my optinion)
{% highlight text %}
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256     ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
{% endhighlight %}

1. ECDHE is faster than any other DH variants and is a standard already (simple DH not widely adopted because its slower)
2. we use RSA key, considering switching to ECDSA in near-future
3. AES128 is considered same security level as AES256 read [here](https://blog.agilebits.com/2013/03/09/guess-why-were-moving-to-256-bit-aes-keys/) or [here](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html)
   there are number of flaws in AES256 also the reason itself why AES192 & AES256 exists is mostly not 'because they are stronger encryption' but due to bureocracy ([3 security levels needed](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/14068/why-most-people-use-256-bit-encryption-instead-of-128-bit/19762#19762)).
4. choose suite with [GCM (Galios/Counter Mode)](http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/GCM_Mode) instead of [CBC Mode](http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/CBC_Mode) because GCM faster

#### Breaking compatibility (DES-CBC3-SHA)

1. If u have browser access, some old browsers might lack [TLS 1.2 support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Web_browsers),
for example default Android 4.4 (and lower) browser will fail to connect.
2. AES and ECDHE based suites are available if IE >= 7 AND OS >= Windows Vista. AES does not exist with IE8 on WinXP.

To keep compatibility with Windows XP (and other old software) try enabling the DES-CBC3-SHA cypher, it is slow but still considered secure.

[IE Supported cipher suites](https://github.com/client9/sslassert/wiki/IE-Supported-Cipher-Suites).

#### TLS 1.3, Mobile specifics, chacha(cha)?

Since Apple limits TLS to 1.2 looking into future there is already TLS 1.3 draft that solves few remaining TLS problems:

* TLS 1.3 [reduces the handshake](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rescorla-tls13-new-flows-00) (latency)
* It is not 100% but [current iOS does support hardware accelerated AES](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4812474/does-iphone-support-hardware-accelerated-aes-encryption), yet another reason to select RSA+AES, and ofc. modern desktop CPUs do have AES enc/dec.
* **ChaCha20-Poly1305 cypher is three times faster than AES-128-GCM on mobile devices**.
  Spending less time on decryption means faster page rendering and better battery life [blog.cloudflare.com](https://blog.cloudflare.com/do-the-chacha-better-mobile-performance-with-cryptography/).
  On desktop computers with hardware AES support, AES-128-GCM is still the faster choice.
  Unfortunately **AWS ELB does not support ChaCha20** cypher atm.
